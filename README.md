# Delivery Man

## Description

Delivery Man is a transport simulation game where the player takes on the role of a DHL transporter driver. The player's objective is to load the packages onto the transporter by dragging and dropping them from the conveyor belt onto the transporter. Once the transporter is fully loaded, it will depart and the player will earn points. However, if the conveyor belt becomes overloaded with packages, the game will end.

## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)

- A conveyor belt at the bottom of the screen that moves packages of various sizes.
- A transporter truck that has limited capacity and can be loaded with packages from the conveyor belt.
- The ability for the player to drag and drop packages from the conveyor belt onto the transporter.
- A score counter that keeps track of the number of the transporters that is fully loaded with packages.
- when the conveyor belt becomes overloaded with packages, the game is over
